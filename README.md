# 2021_FL_OR_REU
FSU &amp; Pacific U distributed REU spring 2021

Dec 19, 2025 notes
still very few examples published looking at what causes difference to 
methods for analysis may be valuable, but probably with some (better) data. 
publish a figure & summary is potentially useful. 

•	Next steps
find journal that publishes figures, and look at scope
•	wait to work with data
•	early in spring, do REU organizing and figure out what that will be so there’s a plan that can use these data, build on them, and include them. 
•	work on analyses of these data to ID pitfalls, issues before the next REU
